       <h1>Lemon 0 Team bios:</h1>
       <h2>Jaiden</h2>
        <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 201321.png" alt="Jaiden Bates" />
        <p>Jaiden is the shortest in the group, often getting made fun of for it. He is a caring person but also is very annoying by way of using brainrot terms. He loves writing and also wants to be an english teacher. He spends a lot of time with Tyler and Alex. Self-proclaimed "sigma". Notes that he has 10 days of his life spent in Elden Ring. He is also the person who created this website!</p>
      <h2>Alex</h2>
      <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 194754.png" alt="Alex Boulton" />
        <p>Alex is the gentle giant of the friend group. He has trouble conveying emotions but when he does, he is very nice. He also can be annoying with the brainrot. He thinks Overwatch is better than Fortnite and plays a lot of Hollow knight. Alex wants to do something with music someday. He also claims that edging is better than gooning</p>
        <h2>Tyler</h2>
        <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 195913.png" alt="Tyler Skipper" />
        <p>He likes his women like he likes his seven layer bars. He doesn't like seven layer bars. In fact, he is currently in a relationship with other member of Lemon 0, Leo. Tyler boasts five 100% playthroughs of Cyberpunk 2077. Tyler is a very nice persone who enjoys to pretend he is in love with Jaiden. He is a good person and a talented trumpet player, along with Jaiden, Carl, Alex, and (formerly) Tristan.</p>
       <h2>Carl</h2>
       <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 200230.png" alt="Carl Russell" />
        <p>Carl is who many consider to be the brains of the group. Carl highly resembles a chicken with a ponytail, thus the picture. He is a talented track runner and student. He is silently shamed by friends for being a "stinky switch player". Carl generally has a nice attitude and even nicer thighs. Jokes aside, we love Carl!</p>
       <h2>Rickey</h2>
         <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 195828.png" alt="Rickey Tenney" />
       <p>Rickey is the friend who can be both absolutely hilarious and wise. He can say the goofiest things with a straight face. He is also known as Rickle Tikle Tron 2000. He is currently in a relationship with a nice girl and we all expect them to last a long time. Truly a skibidi sigma, that Rickey</p>
        <h2>Tristan</h2>
        <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 195353.png" alt="Tristan Clack" />
        <p>Tristan is the most mysterious of the group by far. He always has some information that suprises us. Tristan knows a startling amount of things about history. He is very well educated and is smarter than he seems on the outside. Tristan is currently the baritone player of the band, but used to play trumpet. Tristan Is also very impulsive and does about what ever comes to mind.</p>
        <h2>Rufus</h2>
        <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 195154.png" alt="Rufus Desserano" />
        <p>Rufus' name isn't actually Rufus. It is Alex. We call him Rufus as to not confuse him with the other one. He is often made fun of for being a ginger. He hopes to be the lucky charms mascot someday. His hobbies include running to the other side of the rainbow, protecting his pot of gold, and going out to the pub for a pint. Ginger jokes aside, Rufus is a solid guy.</p>
        <h2>Leo</h2>
        <img src="C:\The Website\Images\Screenshot 2024-04-20 194707.png" alt="Leo Brock" />
        <p>Leo is the partner of Tyler that we mentioned before. Leo is a part of drama, Band, and Chorus. Leo is a nice person and the newest member of Lemon 0. Leo is a cool person who likes (semi-obsessed with) Spider-Man. Leo is a great addition to the group.</p>
